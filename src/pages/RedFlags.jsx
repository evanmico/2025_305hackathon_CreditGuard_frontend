      <h1>⚠️ Things to Watch Out For</h1>
      <p>
        Credit card companies are often tricky in how they present their offers. Here are common practices to be aware of:
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>💰 Exorbitant Interest Rates</h2>
        <p>
          Some cards advertise low introductory rates, but the actual APR can jump to 25–30% after a few months.
          A "normal" APR is usually around 15–20%. Anything higher is considered steep unless you have poor credit.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>📄 Hidden Fees</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Annual Fees</strong> – Not always obvious upfront</li>
          <li><strong>Foreign Transaction Fees</strong> – Up to 3% per purchase abroad</li>
          <li><strong>Balance Transfer Fees</strong> – Often 3–5% of the amount moved</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>📉 Buried APR Hikes</h2>
        <p>
          Many cards promote “0% APR for 12 months” — but the future APR after that may be much higher and buried deep in the terms.
          Always check the <em>ongoing APR</em> after the promo period.

      <section>
        <h2>🧾 Minimum Payment Traps</h2>
        <p>
          Paying only the minimum each month means you’ll be in debt much longer and pay significantly more in interest.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🎯 Teaser Rewards</h2>
        <p>
          Some cards offer big signup bonuses, but only if you spend a large amount in a short time. Make sure you can hit those targets without overspending.
